  <!--Brief bio of myself-->
  <p>My name is Nafisa Nawshin. I am a sophmore in Thomas A. Edison CTE HS. My age is 15 and my birthday is June 3rd. I take classes in Web Development as my shop. I plan on becoming a master in computer science to get a computer science job that will give me lots of money and make my parents proud. I am very intrested in learning more about Web Development and majoring in the computer science category. This class is important to me because I need it for a foundation to computer science. </p>

    <li>My cat Goldie</li>
    <li>My phone</li>
